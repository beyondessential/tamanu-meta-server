# Cluster authentication mechanism — research spike (H1)

Output of the H1 spike. Determines how Canopy authenticates to and reads from external
Kubernetes clusters, feeding the cluster-registration settings page specified in
`monitoring/kubernetes.md` (K8S). Companion to J1, which maps *what* Canopy reads inside
a namespace; this document covers *how* Canopy is authorised to read it.

Working direction, not yet settled. Open items are listed at the end.

## Sources

Every infrastructure fact below is read from `beyondessential/ops` (`pulumi/`) or the
Canopy tree, not inferred: `k8s-essentials/tailscale.ts` (operator install),
`k8s-essentials/roles/data-engineer.ts` (RBAC precedent),
`tamanu/on-k8s/src/central/CentralServer.ts` (database exposure),
`canopy/src/canopy-sa.ts` and `canopy/src/servers.ts` (Canopy's own posture),
`canopy/src/jobs.ts` (worker replica counts), `first-officer/src/index.ts` (per-cluster
service precedent), and `crates/commons-servers/src/` (device auth, backup secrets).

## The problem splits in two

The card frames the choice as Kubernetes-layer delegation vs network layer vs Canopy
owning an OIDC/IAM flow. Those stop competing once Canopy's two distinct needs are
separated, because they are answered at different layers:

1. **Reading Kubernetes objects** for the six infra checks, the identity picker, and the
   CNPG secret. This goes through the kube API server and needs *authorisation*.
2. **Opening a Postgres connection** to `<prefix>-db-rw` for the `alertd` harvest. This
   needs L4 *reachability* to a service inside the cluster, which reading objects through
   the API server does not provide.

Any design that only answers the first leaves the harvest needing a second mechanism.

## Decision: an in-cluster relay that dials Canopy

A small Canopy-authored service runs in each cluster. It holds the Kubernetes read
permissions, connects to each local Postgres, and opens an outbound long-lived connection
to Canopy. Canopy asks it for what it needs; the relay never accepts inbound connections
and Canopy never talks to the kube API of an external cluster directly.

### Why this over direct access

**The capability surface is the relay's method set, not the RBAC surface.** This is the
decisive argument. RBAC cannot express "you may read this Secret only in order to connect
to that database". Under any direct-access design Canopy holds `secrets: get/list/watch`
across every Tamanu namespace and is trusted to touch only `<prefix>-db-app`. Under the
relay, Canopy holds a verb that returns check results, and the credential is never on the
wire.

**Per-server database reachability comes free.** The relay reaches `<prefix>-db-rw` on a
ClusterIP. Direct access would need either one tailnet-exposed Service per facility per
deploy, or `create` on `pods/portforward`, which grants reach to any port on any pod and
defeats read-only access for a service identity.

**Canopy needs no outbound path to clusters.** The relay dials Canopy, which already
accepts inbound.

**Relay liveness is a direct connectivity signal.** A dropped connection is immediate,
rather than inferred from a failed poll. This maps onto the per-cluster connectivity
self-alert K8S already specifies.

### The alertd harvest runs in the relay

B1's plan has `bestool-alertd` embedded as a library in a Canopy worker, dialling each
instance's Postgres. It belongs in the relay instead: the relay runs the checks against
local Postgres and reports results upward. Database credentials never leave the cluster
and query traffic never crosses the network, only check results.

This is a revision to the B1 plan, and N1 is scoped from it.

### Transport: QUIC over the tailnet

The relay needs a long-lived bidirectional connection, which the existing device API does
not provide: it is HTTP request/response over axum handlers. So the device API is not the
transport, whatever it contributes to identity.

QUIC over Tailscale, with the TLS layer carrying throwaway certificates. WireGuard already
provides confidentiality and peer authentication, so the TLS handshake QUIC mandates is
satisfied rather than relied on. QUIC's multiplexed streams let Canopy hold several
outstanding requests to one relay without head-of-line blocking, and its connection
migration survives network blips that would drop a TCP stream.

`quinn` is the implementation. The workspace already standardises on rustls with the
`aws-lc-rs` provider, deliberately and with explicit Cargo.toml comments about not pulling
in a second provider, so quinn must be configured onto that provider rather than
defaulting to `ring`.

### Authentication: the tailnet peer's tag

Canopy resolves the QUIC connection's remote address through `TailnetDirectory::lookup`
and checks the returned entry's tags. This is exactly what
`commons-servers/src/device_auth/tailnet.rs` already does for HTTP requests: gate on
`is_tailnet_ip`, look the address up in the directory, require a tag, then identify the
peer. The only change is taking the address from the QUIC connection instead of axum's
`ClientIp` extractor.

The tag check is load-bearing rather than defence in depth. With certificate verification
skipped, the tailnet ACL plus this check are the whole gate, so without it any tailnet node
that can reach the port is a relay.

Optional hardening, cheap and not a PKI: the relay generates a keypair at enrollment,
Canopy stores its SPKI fingerprint against the relay record, and verification checks that
pin. No CA, no chain, no rotation infrastructure, so an ACL mistake is not immediately
fatal.

### Identity model

A relay fits Canopy's device model without straining it: `devices` carries no `server_id`,
association runs through the many-to-many `device_server_associations`, and a device with
no server associations is already an ordinary case that `tailnet_sweeps` explicitly
handles. A relay is a device with a new `role` value, not a new principal type, and it
inherits enrollment and connection tracking as they stand. Only the transport differs.

### Both ends need a Tailscale sidecar

The relay pod carries a sidecar, making the pod itself a tailnet node, so no cluster-level
egress plumbing is needed in the Tamanu cluster. One tailnet node per cluster, not per
facility.

Canopy needs one too. Its current tailnet presence is the operator Ingress
(`canopy/src/servers.ts`, `ingressClassName: 'tailscale'`), which is HTTP-shaped and
cannot carry a QUIC listener. The sidecar goes on the singleton worker that owns the relay
connections, which keeps the operator's Ingress and LoadBalancer paths out of the design
entirely.

**Both sidecars must run kernel-mode networking.** A Tailscale sidecar in userspace mode
exposes a SOCKS5/HTTP proxy, which is TCP-only, so QUIC will not pass. Kernel mode means
`TS_USERSPACE=false`, the `NET_ADMIN` capability, and a TUN device. There is precedent:
the operator itself runs with `capabilities: { add: ['NET_ADMIN'] }` in
`k8s-essentials/tailscale.ts`.

Pod Security Standards do not block this. `restricted` is enforced only on `hnc-system`
(`k8s-essentials/hnc/namespace.ts`); `tamanu-super` (`tamanu/k8s-infra/superns.ts`) and
the deploy namespaces beneath it carry no PSS labels, and the enforcement does not
propagate.

The relay should get its own namespace rather than living in a Tamanu deploy namespace,
following `first-officer` and `bestool-proxy`, so its pod spec is fully under Canopy's
control.

### Rejected for the relay end: tsnet

tsnet embeds a Tailscale node in a Go program with no sidecar, no `NET_ADMIN` and no TUN,
and it does support UDP: `ListenPacket(network, addr) (net.PacketConn, error)`, added in
v1.68.0, taking `"udp"` / `"udp4"` / `"udp6"`. A `net.PacketConn` is what quic-go accepts,
so QUIC over tsnet is viable in principle. `Dial` does not document UDP support, which
matters because the relay is the QUIC client, so the outbound path would need verifying.

Rejected for two reasons. First, it solves only half the problem: Canopy is Rust, so tsnet
cannot serve its end, and Canopy needs a tailnet UDP socket for the listener regardless.
The kernel-mode sidecar would be required on Canopy's worker anyway, so tsnet adds a Go
component without removing the capability requirement.

Second, a Go relay cannot embed `bestool-alertd` as a Rust library, which is the property
B1 wanted so the harvest's checks cannot drift from what servers run elsewhere. Keeping it
would need a Rust-to-Go FFI boundary, with cgo and two toolchains in the arm64 image build.

Worth keeping available for one case: a future external cluster whose operator will not
grant `NET_ADMIN`. tsnet would be an escape hatch for the relay end alone, affecting
neither the Canopy end nor the protocol. This argues for keeping the relay's transport
layer swappable, not for starting there.

### RBAC the relay needs

The read set does not disappear, it moves to the relay's ServiceAccount. What shrinks is
the blast radius of a Canopy compromise, which becomes the relay's method list rather than
the whole read set.

`k8s-essentials/roles/data-engineer.ts` is the pattern to copy: a ClusterRole bound to a
subject, whose rules are already close to what J1 requires. The relay's role grants
`get`/`list`/`watch` only over `pods`, `services`, `endpoints`, `namespaces`,
`persistentvolumeclaims`, `secrets`, `configmaps`, `apps/deployments`, `batch/jobs`,
`postgresql.cnpg.io/clusters`, `gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateways` and `httproutes`,
`networking.k8s.io/ingresses` while the Envoy migration lasts, and pod metrics. It carries
neither `pods/exec` nor `pods/portforward`, which `data-engineer` holds for humans.

### What Canopy stores per cluster

No cluster credentials. A registered cluster is a relay identity and nothing else, so
there is no secret to encrypt at rest and no rotation schedule to own. Testing a cluster's
connection at registration time is a check that its relay is connected and answering.

### Canopy's own cluster

Canopy already reads Kubernetes in its own namespace through its ServiceAccount
(`commons-servers/src/backup_secrets.rs` via `kube::Client::try_default()`, backed by the
namespaced `Role` in `canopy/src/canopy-sa.ts`). Reading co-resident Tamanu instances
needs that widened beyond its own namespace, which is the card's in-cluster requirement.

Two options: run a relay in Canopy's cluster like any other, keeping one code path and one
model; or read the local cluster directly with a widened ClusterRole, which is more robust
because it does not depend on the relay being up. Not settled.

## Costs

**A second deployable.** Canopy grows a service with its own release cycle, deployed into
every cluster. This brings version skew (relay vN against Canopy vM) and needs protocol
versioning from the start. It is the one cost the direct-access designs did not carry, and
it turns "Canopy connects to clusters" into "Canopy grows a distributed agent".

**Judged worth it** because the database harvest forces either per-facility tailnet nodes
or `portforward` under any direct design, and the relay is the only option that solves it
without widening the surface. Worth revisiting if the fleet stays at two clusters.

## Considered and rejected

**Canopy owning an IAM/OIDC flow.** Canopy already has IRSA: `canopy/src/canopy-sa.ts`
annotates every ServiceAccount with `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`. So cross-account
AssumeRole into a reader role, minting an EKS token per request, was viable with no new
network plumbing, reaching the EKS public endpoint over the internet. Rejected because it
answers only the object-read half, leaving the harvest to a second mechanism, and because
it gives Canopy the full RBAC surface.

**The Tailscale operator's API server proxy.** `k8s-essentials/tailscale.ts` sets
`apiServerProxyConfig.mode: 'true'`, which is auth mode rather than `noauth`: the proxy
authenticates the calling tailnet identity and impersonates it into the kube API via
`Impersonate-User` / `Impersonate-Group` headers derived from tailnet ACL grants. Every
cluster with `tailscaleEnabled` already publishes its API server on the tailnet as
`k8s-operator-<clusterFullName>`. This was the leading candidate and remains a sound
fallback. Rejected for the same two reasons as the IAM route, plus it requires Canopy to
gain tailnet egress, which it does not have today: there is no `tailnet-fqdn` ExternalName,
no egress ProxyGroup and no `subnetRouter` anywhere in the ops Pulumi, and the one
Connector is `exitNode: true`, which is the opposite direction.

Note that Canopy's tailnet Ingress (`canopy/src/servers.ts`, `ingressClassName:
'tailscale'`) is inbound only and says nothing about egress, and the existing Secret read
is in-namespace against the in-cluster API server, so neither demonstrates outbound
tailnet reachability.

## Failure domain

Routing cluster access over the tailnet introduces no new single point of failure.
Canopy's admin authentication is already tailnet-gated
(`commons-servers/src/tailscale_auth.rs` trusts `Tailscale-User-Login`), so a tailnet
outage already makes Canopy unreachable to operators.

Relay liveness becomes the per-cluster connectivity self-alert K8S specifies. Note the
diagnosis shifts: "cluster unreachable" becomes "relay not connected", which can mean the
relay is down while the cluster is healthy.

## Open items

- **Whether the extra deployable is warranted** at a fleet of two clusters, versus the API
  server proxy fallback.
- **Kernel-mode sidecar networking**, confirmed against a real deployment. Admission does
  not block it, but if UDP still cannot be made to pass, the fallbacks are tsnet at the
  relay end or HTTP/2 bidirectional streaming over TCP for both.
- **Whether to pin the relay's SPKI fingerprint** at enrollment, or rely on the tailnet
  ACL and tag check alone.
- **Canopy's own cluster**: relay like any other, or direct in-cluster reads with a
  widened ClusterRole.
- **The relay's method set**, which is the security boundary and so needs designing
  deliberately rather than growing per check.
- **Who deploys the relay** and how it is versioned against Canopy.
- **K8S spec impact**: "Canopy reads each registered cluster with read-only access" and
  the registration page both change shape if registration becomes relay enrollment.
