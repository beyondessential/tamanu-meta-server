# Spec rules

Specs live in `.workhorse/specs/<area>/<name>.md`.
This file is canopy's house style; it sits on top of the Workhorse spec conventions in `.agents/docs/spec-format.md` and wins wherever the two differ.

A spec is the durable description of **what** the system requires.
It is read by someone deciding whether the implementation is correct, or re-implementing the feature from scratch — not as a narrative of how the code works or how it came to be.

Spec ids, frontmatter, and the fold-vs-create-vs-split decision follow `.agents/docs/spec-format.md`.
The spec-first workflow — spec before implementation before tests — is carried by the Workhorse skills (Draft spec changes, Implement this, Draft test cases); it is not restated here.

## Prose, not checklists

Specs are written in markdown prose with each sentence on its own line and no hard-wrapping.
This balances ease of writing and diff parseability.
Acceptance criteria are prose sentences rather than `- [ ]` checklist items; this overrides the checklist format shown in `.agents/docs/spec-format.md`.

This rule is about specs only.
Implementation plans in `.workhorse/plans/` are working documents, not specs: use `- [ ]` checkboxes there to track build steps, and tick them off (`- [x]`) as you complete them.

## Cross-references

Link a spec to a related spec — or reference one from any other markdown — by its path under its id: `[BAK](../public-server/backup.md)`.
From code, tie an implementation back to its spec with an inline `// spec: BAK` comment.

## What, not how

- Describe **what** the system requires, not **how** the code achieves it.
  Keep out of spec text: tool and command names (`sfdisk`, `kopia snapshot create`), crate and library names, syscall names (`splice(2)`), internal API details, data-structure choices, and environment variable names used only by the implementation.
- Acceptable, because external actors or other components depend on them: interface contracts — config file paths and formats, on-disk and on-the-wire shapes, endpoint shapes, partition UUIDs, credential scopes.
- The test: would someone re-implementing the feature from scratch be constrained to the same choice?
  If not, it's an implementation detail and doesn't belong in the spec.

## Present, not past

- State what the system does, not how it got there.
  No "this supersedes X", "formerly Y", "a spike settled Z", changelog entries, or migration narration.
- When something is removed or replaced, edit the spec to describe the new reality and delete the old text, rather than describing the transition.
  The git history is the record of change; the spec is the record of the present.

## Own behaviour, not a dependency's internals

- Describe the system's own behaviour and contracts: the request shape it handles, the guarantee it makes.
  Don't narrate a dependency's decision logic or version-specific quirks beyond the minimum needed to justify a requirement.
- Don't scaffold or label: no "Strategy A/B", "Phase N", or plan tags in spec prose.
  Describe the mechanism directly.

## Check the thing being replaced

- A spec that replaces an existing artefact — an inventory file, a config, a hand-kept list — is written against that artefact's actual contents, read first.
  Any claim about what the artefact holds ("carries no secret", "is only these fields", "nothing depends on it") is checked against every instance of it, not the one that was open.
- Secrets specifically: grep the artefact for credentials, tokens, salts, and keys before asserting that what replaces it needs none.
  A single file carrying one is the whole design, and finding it in review costs the design, not a sentence.
