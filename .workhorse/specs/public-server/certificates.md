# Application names and certificates

An application reaches Canopy for the two things it cannot do for itself about its own public name: publishing the address records that make the name resolve, and obtaining a TLS certificate for it.
Both are confined to names within the domains the application's group controls, and both are refused unless an operator has granted that application the matching permission (see [DOM](../servers/domains.md)).

Canopy is the only holder of DNS write access and of the certificate authority account.
An application holds neither, which is the point: a fleet where every application carried zone credentials would put the whole zone at the mercy of its least-defended member.

## Why Canopy issues

An application's name resolves to an address that may not be reachable from the public internet, and often is not: a facility application sits behind someone else's NAT.
So the challenge types that prove control by answering on the name's own address are unavailable, and proving control through DNS is the only route left.
Proving control through DNS means writing to the zone, and Canopy already holds that access on the group's behalf.

Centralising issuance also puts the authority's rate limits, the record of every certificate's expiry, and the alerting when renewal stops working in one place — the same place that already watches the fleet.

## Identity and authorisation

A certificate or address request authenticates as the device enrolled against the application it concerns, by either transport Canopy already accepts for devices (see [DID](machine-identity.md)).

Every request is checked in the same order, and each check is reported distinctly so a misconfiguration is diagnosable from the refusal alone:

1. The caller authenticates as a device attached to a live application.
2. That application has the grant the request needs — DNS management for addresses, certificate issuance for certificates.
3. The requested name lies at or beneath a domain the application's *own group* controls.
4. A managed zone covers that domain, so Canopy can act on the name at all.

A name within another group's domain is refused as if unclaimed: the refusal says the application's group does not control the name, and never that another group does, so the endpoint is not a directory of other deployments' names.

A certificate for a name is available to any application of the group that controls it, provided that application holds the certificate grant.
Certificate issuance is deliberately not tied to which application registered the name's addresses: a standby that serves the same name on failover needs the same certificate, and Canopy holds no view of which member is live.

## What an application may act on

An application can ask Canopy what names it is entitled to, rather than discovering the boundary by being refused.
The answer carries the domains its group controls, which of the two grants it holds, and the names it already has addresses registered or certificates issued for, each with when the certificate expires.

That is enough for an agent to work ahead of demand: knowing the domains it may use and what it already holds, it can request a certificate before anything asks for one, and renew before expiry, instead of discovering at handshake time that it has nothing to serve.

The answer is available both on its own and on the response to a status push, so an agent that already reports status learns of a new domain or a newly granted permission without asking separately (see [STA](statuses.md)).
Both carry the same content, the standalone form being for an agent that wants it without pushing.

An application with no grants, or whose group controls no domain, is told so plainly: the answer is empty rather than an error, since asking what one may do is not itself a privileged act.

## Pausing an application

An application can be paused, and while it is, Canopy makes no new changes on its behalf: no certificate is ordered or renewed for it, and no address record of its is changed.

Pausing withdraws nothing already in place.
The records published stand, the certificates held stay held and collectable until they expire, and the deployment keeps working exactly as it did — a pause being for looking into something, and taking a deployment off the air not being a neutral act to perform while looking.
What stops is Canopy doing anything *new* on that application's behalf.

Revoking one of an application's certificates pauses that application, without being asked.
Revocation and re-issuance would otherwise chase each other: a key revoked as compromised has its replacement requested within minutes by an agent doing exactly what it was built to do, and if the key leaked because the host was compromised, that replacement hands the same attacker a fresh certificate.
So revoking stops the machinery rather than merely redirecting it, and an operator decides when it is safe to start again.
An operator can also pause an application for any other reason, recording why.

Unpausing is an operator's alone: Canopy never lifts a pause itself, however long it has been in place and however much is expiring under it.
Work resumes where it left off — orders already recorded are worked, renewals fall due again, and address changes waiting to be published are published.

A request from a paused application is refused distinguishably, so an agent can tell being paused apart from being unentitled or misconfigured, and wait rather than hammer.
A pause is not a permission: it says *not now*, where a grant withheld says *not you*.

Because a pause suppresses the alerting that would otherwise chase a certificate running out, the pause itself has to be what is visible.
A paused application presents as paused wherever its certificates are presented, with who paused it, when, and why.
And a pause old enough that something has lapsed underneath it is reported against Canopy, since a pause everyone has forgotten is how certificates quietly expire; what wants surfacing is the forgetting rather than the expiry it caused.

## Addresses

An application registers the name it should be reachable at together with the external addresses it is reachable at, and Canopy publishes the address records: the IPv4 addresses as A records, the IPv6 addresses as AAAA records, at that name, in the managed zone the name resolves to.

Registering replaces the addresses previously registered for the name, so an application announces a change of address by registering again, and a registration naming no addresses withdraws the name.
Canopy publishes what it is told: it does not verify that an address is really the application's, the grant being the trust boundary rather than any proof of possession.

Canopy changes only records it created itself.
Because zones are shared, a name may be served by records Canopy knows nothing about, and Canopy neither rewrites nor removes those; it records what it has published so it can tell its own records from everyone else's.

A name's addresses are registered by one application at a time.
While a registration stands, another application registering the same name is refused, so two members of a group cannot fight over where one name points.

## Certificates

### Requesting

An application generates its own key pair and asks Canopy to certify it, submitting a certificate signing request for a single name.
The private key never leaves the application and Canopy never asks for it: Canopy's part is to prove control of the name and return the signed chain.

The signing request is honoured only for exactly the name requested.
Canopy certifies that one name and no other: a request whose subject or alternative names carry anything beyond the requested name is refused rather than trimmed, because silently issuing something narrower than asked would leave an application serving a certificate it does not expect, and issuing something wider would let one application smuggle a second deployment's name past the authorisation check.
Wildcards are refused: a certificate valid for every name in a deployment is not something one member should be able to mint.

The key the request certifies must be strong enough to be worth certifying, and Canopy states what it accepts rather than deferring to whatever the authority happens to allow that year.

### Fulfilment is not immediate

Proving control through DNS takes as long as it takes for the authority to see a record Canopy has just published — tens of seconds at best, minutes when a resolver holds a negative answer.
That is far longer than any client will wait mid-handshake, so requesting a certificate and collecting it are separate steps: a request is accepted and acknowledged, Canopy works the order in the background, and the application collects the result when it is ready.

An application therefore holds a certificate before it needs one, rather than obtaining one at the moment a client arrives.
Canopy's contract is only that a request is durable once accepted and that its outcome becomes collectable; scheduling requests early enough to be useful is the application's business.

Repeating a request for a name Canopy already holds a valid certificate for returns the one it holds rather than ordering another, so an application that has lost its local copy — restarted, redeployed, cache cleared — is served without spending the authority's budget.
A request naming a key different from the one already certified is a new order, since the stored chain certifies a key the application no longer holds.

### What Canopy keeps

Canopy keeps the certificate it obtained, the name it covers, the application it was issued for, and when it expires.
It keeps no private key, having never held one.

Holding the chain is what lets Canopy answer a repeat request without a fresh order, renew before expiry without being asked, and report a certificate that is running out.

### Lifetime

An authority may offer certificates of more than one lifetime, named as profiles, and an application's certificates are requested under one of them.
The profiles on offer are whatever the authority advertises, so Canopy presents that set rather than a list of its own, and a profile the authority has withdrawn is reported as unavailable instead of being requested and refused.

An application's profile is an operator's choice per application, because lifetime is a property of how a deployment is run rather than of Canopy: a cloud deployment whose issuance is exercised constantly can carry a short lifetime, where an on-premises one that may be offline for days cannot.
Every application takes the longest profile the authority offers until an operator says otherwise, so a short lifetime is something adopted deliberately for an application rather than a default anyone inherits.

### Renewal

Canopy renews a certificate it holds before it expires, without being asked, and the renewed chain becomes collectable the same way the first one did.
An application that collects periodically therefore stays current without tracking expiry itself, and one that asks again gets whatever is newest.

When to renew comes from the authority when it will say: an authority that publishes renewal information is asked when it would like this certificate replaced, and Canopy renews in the window it names.
Failing that, Canopy renews after a fixed fraction of the certificate's own life has passed.
Neither is a fixed interval, because a fixed interval cannot serve both lifetimes: a window measured in weeks would leave a certificate that lives days permanently overdue, and one measured in hours would renew a long-lived certificate hundreds of times over.
Where the authority accounts for a renewal as replacing a particular certificate, Canopy tells it which, so a renewal is not mistaken for an additional certificate.

Renewal stops when the certificate is no longer wanted: a name whose group has released the domain it sits under is not renewed, nor is a certificate for an application whose grant has been revoked or that has been archived.
A grant revoked does not withdraw the certificate already issued — it cannot be recalled once it exists — but it does end the renewals that would extend it.

### Revocation

An operator can revoke a certificate Canopy holds, saying why.
Canopy holds the account that obtained it, which is authority enough to revoke it — the application's private key is not needed and is not asked for.

Revocation exists for the day something has gone wrong, so it is reachable where the certificate is presented rather than filed away as a maintenance procedure, and it is destructive enough to confirm before it happens.
It cannot be undone: a revoked certificate stays revoked, and the remedy is a new one.

Canopy stops renewing a revoked certificate and records who revoked it, when, and the reason given.

An application collecting a certificate it holds locally is told that it has been revoked, so it stops serving something clients will reject, and is told separately whether the key it holds is condemned along with it.
The two are different instructions: any revocation means ask for a replacement, but only a compromised key means the key pair has to be discarded first.
Everything else can be re-requested with the key the application already holds.

Where the reason given is that the key is compromised, that key is not certified again — for any name, by any application, since a leaked key is leaked whoever asks next.
A request naming it is refused distinguishably from every other refusal, so an agent can generate a fresh key and ask again on the strength of the refusal alone, without a human reading it and without waiting for an operator to intervene on the application.
Recovering from a leaked key is exactly the moment when nobody has attention to spare, so it is the moment the machinery has to work unattended.
Any other reason leaves the key usable, since a certificate superseded or a deployment retired says nothing about the key itself.

### When issuance fails

An order that fails is retried, with the interval between attempts growing, because most failures are the authority being briefly unavailable or a record not yet visible.

A certificate that is running out is a fact about the application that serves it, so it is filed against that application like any other check: it joins that application's group's incident and reaches the people who run the deployment (see [CHK](../monitoring/checks.md)).
It warns while there is still room to recover and fails as the remaining life runs down, and both thresholds are fractions of the certificate's own lifetime rather than fixed durations — otherwise the same alert would fire far too late for a short-lived certificate and far too early for a long-lived one.
A certificate that has expired outright fails regardless.

A paused application raises none of this either, for the same reason: Canopy has been told to stop acting on its behalf, so a certificate running down is the expected consequence rather than a failure. What is reported instead is the pause, and eventually the pause having been forgotten.

Except that a certificate for a name the application is no longer entitled to raises nothing at all, however far past expiry it is.
Its group may have released the domain it sat under, the application's grant may have been revoked, or the application may have been archived — and in each case Canopy deliberately stopped renewing it, so its running out is the intended outcome rather than a failure to report.
Alerting on it would mean every deliberate withdrawal left an alert behind that no action could clear, which teaches an operator to ignore the alert that matters.
Whether the name is still entitled is asked when the alert is evaluated rather than remembered from when renewal stopped, so a domain reclaimed by its group brings its certificates back into scope.

An order that has never produced a certificate is distinguished from one extending a certificate that already exists, so an operator can tell a deployment that never came up from one about to go dark.

Canopy's own inability to issue is not any one application's fault and is reported against Canopy instead (see [SELF](../private-server/self-alerts.md)): an authority that cannot be reached, an account Canopy cannot use, and the authority's rate limits being exhausted.
Those limits are shared across every group whose domain sits in the same zone, so running them down is a fleet-wide fault rather than one group's: Canopy reports being throttled, and does not consume what remains retrying a name that has just failed.
Reporting the two apart matters because they call for different people — an application's certificate running out is that deployment's problem to notice, and Canopy being unable to issue at all is Canopy's.

## Presentation

An application presents the names it has registered — with the addresses published for each, and whether the zone has caught up with what it asked for — and the certificates Canopy holds for it, each with the name it covers, the profile it was issued under, and when it expires, given both as an instant and as how long is left.
A request that has not yet produced a certificate presents as pending, or as failed with the reason.
An operator sets the application's profile where its other permissions are set, and pauses or unpauses it from the same place, a pause showing who set it, when, and why.

A group presents, under each domain it controls, the names in use beneath it and which of them hold a current certificate, so whether a deployment's names are healthy is answerable without visiting each of its applications.

The authority Canopy is configured to use is presented to operators along with the profiles it advertises and whether Canopy's account with it is usable, since that is where a misconfiguration of issuance shows up rather than on any one application.
