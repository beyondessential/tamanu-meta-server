# Groups

A group is what Canopy holds shared state against: one backup repository with its passphrase and retention, one incident target with its notification channel and delays, the domain names it claims, and one billing identity.
The fleet is grouped so that what is true of several machines at once is watched, alerted, and paid for in one place.

## Scope

This spec covers the state a group holds, how a group's headline rank is derived, what a group's environments are, and what Canopy calls a group and an environment.

It does not cover which machines and applications a group contains or how an operator puts them there (see [FLT](overview.md), "Groups").

## What a group holds

What makes a group one group is the state Canopy attaches to it rather than anything its members have in common.

Against a group Canopy holds:

- one backup configuration and the repository it names, with the group's passphrase, retention, and placement (see [BKO](../private-server/backup.md));
- one incident target, with the channel its trouble is announced on and the delays before it opens and closes (see [INC](../monitoring/incidents.md));
- the domain names it claims, and the name-management grants that work from them (see [DOM](domains.md));
- one billing identity, which every member's effective labels derive from (see [APP](application-types.md), "Billing attribution").

A machine belonging to no group carries none of it: its issues reach no incident target and contribute to no incident (see [INC](../monitoring/incidents.md)), and it has no billing attribution (see [APP](application-types.md)).

Membership constrains neither application type nor rank, so a group holds whatever an operator puts in it.

The fleet is organised one group per customer site, holding that site's machines whatever application each runs and whatever environment each serves.
That is how operators use groups rather than a rule Canopy enforces, and a group may equally hold machines belonging to no customer, such as an internal demo.

## Environments

An application's rank is its environment tier: production, clone, demo, test, or dev.
An operator sets it, and an application may carry none.

A group's applications at one rank are one of its environments, so a site's production central and the facilities syncing to it are that site's production environment (see [FLT](overview.md), "Environments").

An environment is where a group's applications are going next: it holds at most one open upgrade plan, and the closed plans that preceded it, so a group holds as many open plans as it has environments going somewhere (see [UPG](../private-server/upgrade-plans.md)).
A maintenance window covers one environment where an operator declares it over one (see [MNT](../monitoring/maintenance.md)).
An environment's version is its own central's, derived the way a group's headline version is (see [APP](application-types.md), "Versions").
Everything else Canopy attaches belongs to the group, and it presents a group's members under their rank.

## A group's headline rank

A group holds no rank of its own.
Its headline rank is the highest rank held by any of its applications, production outranking clone, then demo, then test, then dev.
The fleet listing buckets each group under its headline rank, and a group whose applications are all unranked is left out of that bucketing.
A group's billing stage is the same value (see [APP](application-types.md), "Billing attribution").

The headline rank is distinct from the headline version, which is the version the group's highest-ranked central reports (see [APP](application-types.md), "Versions").
A group's headline environment is its applications at its headline rank, and it is the environment an unranked application belongs to.

## Naming

Canopy calls a group a group wherever it appears: in the operator interface, in its API, and throughout this spec set.
An environment names a group's applications at one rank, which is the unit some infrastructure outside Canopy calls a deployment.
The Canopy instance names an installation of Canopy itself, so a zone list, an ingress, or an account key belongs to the Canopy instance rather than to any group.

The `billing.deployment` cost-allocation label carries the group's name and keeps that spelling, because it is read outside Canopy: by cloud cost allocation, and by every machine reading its effective tags (see [APP](application-types.md), [STA](../public-server/statuses.md)).
