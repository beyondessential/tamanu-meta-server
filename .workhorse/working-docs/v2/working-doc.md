# Split the core model: machines, application servers, and identities

Separate Canopy's `server` into a machine and an application server, and retire `device` into an identity and a machine, so machine-level facts have somewhere of their own to live.

## Terminology

Direction agreed: rename rather than qualify.
"Server" means too many things, and "application server" carries the confusion forward.

- **Application** — what a `server` is today, minus its machine-ish columns. What the status page presents.
- **Machine** — the host an application runs on. New concept, though bestool's existing server ID is really this.
- **Identity** — what a `device` is today: a set of keys, with an optional Tailscale identity. Not a machine.

A machine usually has an identity, and one or more applications on it.

## Behaviour

### Cardinality

- An application has zero or one machine, never two.
- A machine has one or more applications.
  Whether "one or more" is enforced is an open question (see below) — the delete-then-recreate case wants a temporary zero.
- On Kubernetes an application has no machine at all; machine-less is a first-class case, not a degenerate one.
- A Kubernetes cluster is a separate entity beside machines, not a machine of a special class.

### How a machine comes into being

There is no standalone "create a machine" flow, at least not initially.
Machines are created through creating applications, which keeps the invariant that a machine has applications on it reachable by construction.

- The migration creates one machine per existing server, 1:1.
- The application creation form gains a machine section.
  By default it creates a new machine for that application.
  Unticking that offers a search dropdown to select an existing machine instead.

### Monitoring and reachability

Working position: reachability is a machine-level concept only, and applications have nothing called reachability.
Applications carry a monitoring on/off toggle; machines carry one too.
See the reachability findings below — pingtask and the legacy `tamanu` heartbeat complicate this and it is not settled.

## Reachability as it stands today

Three distinct things wear the name, and they do not split the same way.

**1. `ShortStatus`** (`crates/commons-types/src/status.rs:49`) — up / blip / away / down / gone, derived purely from the age of the latest status row for a server against fixed thresholds (2, 10, 30 minutes).
Presentational only: status dots, the MCP fleet summary's `unreachable` count.
Nothing alerts off it.

**2. The `canopy`/`reachability` check** (`Status::sweep_staleness`, `crates/database/src/statuses.rs:275`) — one check per server, computed from per-source freshness against that server's own `alert_when_down_for` interval, each source graded by its reachability mode (`on`/`quiet`/`off`).
This is the one that alerts, is silenceable (the "Alert when this server is unreachable" switch in `ServerEdit.tsx` *is* the server-scoped silence on it), and feeds incidents and the health rollup.

Pingtask, the third, is being removed as this card is written, so an active HTTP probe of the application is no longer part of the picture.
The backstop it justified in the sweep — "servers with no counted source fall back to the latest status row, any source" — goes with it.

### What that implies for the split

Both are "did a reporter reach us recently".
The reporter is bestool, and bestool runs on the machine, so both are machine facts.
That supports machine-primary.

The **legacy `tamanu` source** (see [STA](../../specs/public-server/statuses.md), "Legacy pushes"; `crates/public-server/src/statuses.rs:128`) was the other application-subject reporter, but it is going: one server still sends it, and that stops within about a month of this card.
So every remaining reporter is an agent installed on something.

### Reachability attaches to whatever hosts the reporter

That is the rule the split needs, and it holds in both contexts.

On a VM the reporter is bestool, installed on the machine, so bestool going quiet is a machine fact — one fact, with every application on that machine as its consequence.

On Kubernetes the reporter is the relay, and there is one relay per cluster holding one outbound connection (see card J2).
The relay going quiet is a cluster fact, with every application on the cluster as its consequence.
Liveness is not per-application on Kubernetes, because the namespace is a *filing grain* for checks and never a reporter.

So reachability is carried by machines and by clusters, and by neither applications nor namespaces.
This keeps "machine" an honest name: it does not have to stretch to cover clusters, because a cluster is its own entity carrying its own reachability.

An application never goes quiet in its own right.
A dead application on a live machine is not silence — bestool keeps reporting and grades the application's own checks as failed or broken.
Silence only ever means the agent stopped, and the agent belongs to the machine or the cluster.

Health is already documented as independent of reachability (`status.rs:406`), so the two axes are established; this adds a grain to one of them.

Residual edge: a machine hosting two applications reported by two different agents, where one agent goes quiet.
Machine reachability counts sources, so the quiet one raises the machine's reachability warning without saying which application lost its reporter.
Probably acceptable, and the source detail names the quiet source anyway.

## Open questions

- [ ] Does `Scope` gain one variant or two — `Machine(id)` alone, or `Machine(id)` and `Cluster(id)` — given reachability files at both?
- [ ] How does an application present while its machine or cluster is unreachable? It has no reachability of its own to fail, so something has to say why nothing is arriving.
- [ ] Does the per-target down threshold (`alert_when_down_for`, today a `servers` column) move to the machine, and what happens to a machine whose applications disagreed about it before the migration?
- [ ] Is "a machine has at least one application" enforced, or is a temporary zero allowed for the delete-then-recreate case?
- [ ] Does an identity gain a machine association, or is the machine link a property of what reports rather than of who authenticates?
- [ ] Where do `host`, `cloud`, and `geolocation` land, and what does that do to DNS, TLS, and backups, which reach for them today?
- [ ] What does the status page present once applications and machines are separate?

## Transition

bestool's existing server ID is really the machine ID.

- bestool keeps calling it the server ID for now, and Canopy keeps accepting it as such.
- Canopy introduces a machine ID; bestool moves across to it later.
- bestool will grow separate application-subject and machine-subject reporting.
- Canopy needs to recognise a bestool that is not yet sending split data, and split the current coalesced push across the two grains itself.
