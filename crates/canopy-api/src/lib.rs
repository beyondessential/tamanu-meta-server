//! Rust client for canopy's public API.
//!
//! The wire types and the per-endpoint methods in [`schema`] are generated from
//! canopy's OpenAPI document, which lives in the same repository as this crate,
//! so they are the types canopy declares rather than a separate description of
//! them. The document and this crate carry the same version.
//!
//! # Calling canopy
//!
//! [`CanopyClient`] has one method per operation, taking and returning the
//! generated types. The method name comes from the path (`/backup-credentials`
//! becomes `backup_credentials`), with the verb prefixed where a path is served
//! by more than one verb.
//!
//! How a request reaches canopy is the consumer's to decide: this crate depends
//! on no HTTP client, and a consumer supplies a [`CanopyTransport`] which
//! resolves the host, the scheme, and the authentication itself. Any status
//! outside the success range surfaces as [`CanopyHttpError`], since endpoints
//! give particular statuses a meaning only the caller can read.
//!
//! # What the generated types carry
//!
//! Timestamp fields are [`jiff::Timestamp`] rather than text, and credential
//! secrets are wrapped in [`Redacted`] so they stay out of `Debug` output and
//! logs; read them through the inner value. Schemas that carry arbitrary further
//! keys alongside their declared fields generate a map field holding the rest, so
//! those keys can be both sent and read.
//!
//! Generated structs are `#[non_exhaustive]` and carry a builder, so a schema
//! gaining a field leaves construction working for a consumer that does not set
//! it.
