//! Read-only MCP (Model Context Protocol) query interface over the fleet.
//!
//! Spec: `.workhorse/specs/private-server/mcp.md` (id `MCP`).
//!
//! Mounted twice: at `/api/mcp` on the operator surface, behind the
//! tagged-device guard and an "any tailnet user" gate (private-server's
//! `mcp::require_tailnet_user`), and at `/mcp` on the internet-facing
//! surface behind the bearer-token gate (public-server's `mcp` module).
//! Every tool only reads; nothing here mutates the fleet.
//!
//! Tools call the existing `database` read functions directly and shape lean,
//! agent-legible JSON. The one piece of logic that must NOT be reimplemented is
//! backup staleness ("overdue" / "never reported"): `find_backup_problems` and
//! `fleet_summary` (in the `fleet` module) reuse [`database::backup::staleness`]
//! so the verdicts match what the operator UI and the alerting sweep present.
//!
//! Tools are grouped into domain modules (`servers`, `groups`, `versions`,
//! `fleet`, `backups`, `restore`, `incidents`), each contributing its own tool
//! router (via rmcp's `#[tool_router(router = ..., vis = "pub(crate)")]`) that
//! [`CanopyMcp::new`] combines into the single stored `ToolRouter`. `util`
//! holds helpers shared across more than one of those modules.
