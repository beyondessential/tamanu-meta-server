//! Obtaining certificates from an ACME authority.
//!
//! Canopy holds the account and the zone access; a server holds the private key.
//! That split is the whole point: Canopy can prove control of a name, which is
//! what an authority asks for, and never has to be told a private key to do it.
//!
//! The order is driven end to end here — publish the challenge record, tell the
//! authority to look, hand over the server's signing request, collect the chain,
//! clean the record up — because every step of it is one conversation with one
//! authority about one name, and splitting it across the worker would leave a
//! challenge record behind whenever a step in between failed.
