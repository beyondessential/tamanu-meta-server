//! Which catalog entry a check resolves to.
//!
//! **This is not the same question as [`CheckSubject`](crate::subject::CheckSubject),
//! and conflating the two is the trap.** A subject says which half of a
//! unified push a reading belongs to — the box, or the workload. A namespace
//! says which catalog entry the reading's *identity* lives in, so that a
//! ceiling, a rule, a silence and a document attach to the right thing.
//!
//! Nor is it the same question as [`Scope`](../../database/src/issues.rs) — what
//! a *result* is filed against. Reachability is one check filed at every
//! target: two targets, one identity. Reading the target axis and calling it
//! identity is a mistake this model has already made twice.
//!
//! A check is identified by a namespace and a name. `version` is why: a box's
//! version, a Tamanu's version and another product's version are unrelated
//! conditions colliding on one word, and grading them against one ceiling
//! grades none of them.
//!
//! **Namespacing exists because of control over names, not because of
//! targets.** Canopy's own names are curated — we choose every one and can
//! guarantee it means a single thing — so the reserved sources need no
//! namespace and their checks are identified by name alone. Names arriving
//! over the device API are not curated, so they carry a namespace to keep
//! unrelated conditions apart.
