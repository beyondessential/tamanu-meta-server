//! wire: a check that needs the host to run may still be describing the
//! application on it.
//!
//! `disk_free`, `memory`, `load`, `time_sync`, `tailscale` and their like are
//! not application checks that happen to run on a host; they assert something
//! about the box. Canopy filed them against an application only because an
//! application was the only target available.
