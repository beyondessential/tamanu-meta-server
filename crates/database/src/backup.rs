//! Backup-credentials detection / alerting (DB-driven half of the control
//! plane). The persistent models live in [`crate::backups`]; this module owns
//! the periodic *logic*: staleness and report-vs-inventory reconciliation.
//!
//! - [`refs`] — the stable `(source, ref)` alert keys (a contract).
//! - [`staleness`] — staleness scan over reported runs + maintenance staleness.
//! - [`reconcile`] — reconcile device reports against repo inventory.
//!
//! Alerting goes through [`crate::issues::file_check`], which grades
//! each observation through the operator's check policy and bypasses the
//! per-server `is_monitored` gate for group-scoped filings. The preflight
//! (AWS-touching) lives in the `jobs` crate binary, not here — the
//! `database` crate must not gain an AWS dependency — but its alerting uses
//! the same path.
