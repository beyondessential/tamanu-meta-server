//! Reconcile device **reports** against repo **inventory**: cross-check what
//! devices reported (`backup_runs`) against what inspection found in the repo
//! (`backup_repo_observed_snapshots` for the individual snapshots,
//! `backup_repo_snapshots` for the per-source summary).
//!
//! Per scanned `(server, type)`:
//!
//! - **the reported snapshot is not in the repo** → `backup-reconcile-missing`
//!   (`Warning`, per-server). The run named the snapshot it created and the
//!   repository does not hold it: the case reports alone cannot catch, a device
//!   lying about success or an upload that didn't persist. Detecting it needs
//!   the group's repo inventory, but the finding is about the one server whose
//!   report didn't hold up, so it is filed against that server: two servers in
//!   a group can fail it independently, and one recovering must not clear the
//!   other.
//! - **the repo looks behind the report** → `backup-reconcile-recency`
//!   (recorded only, never alerting). The newest snapshot for the source is
//!   older than the moment the reported run froze its data. It compares
//!   timestamps produced by two independent cadences, so it means "something
//!   looks off" and cannot mean more than that.
//! - **recent snapshot but no report** → `backup-reconcile-report-gap`
//!   (`Warning`, per-server, non-paging). The reporting path is broken, not
//!   the backup.
//! - **neither** → genuinely stale; the staleness scan already owns it, emit
//!   nothing.
//!
//! Independently, per `(server, type)`, the latest run that carries both a
//! device-reported size and an inspection-observed size is compared:
//!
//! - **sizes disagree** (both non-zero) → `backup-reconcile-size-mismatch`
//!   (`Warning`, per-server, non-paging). The device reported a snapshot size
//!   that doesn't match what the repo holds.
//!
//! **Absence is only evidence once someone has looked.** Backups run on one
//! cadence and inspection on a slower, independent one, so "the repo doesn't
//! show it" routinely means "nobody has looked since". Every verdict about a
//! run therefore requires an inspection *newer than that run*; where there
//! isn't one, the instance is [`CheckResult::Skipped`] — neither passed nor
//! failed — and a check with nothing decidable is not filed at all, so an
//! already-open finding is left alone rather than cleared on the strength of a
//! lagging inspector.
//!
//! Two things this cannot see, both because a repository leaves no record of an
//! inspection that found nothing: a group whose repository inspection finds
//! entirely empty, and a group whose snapshots have never been itemised.
//! Corruption and staleness own those.
