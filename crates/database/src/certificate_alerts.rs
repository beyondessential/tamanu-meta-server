pub const EXPIRY_REF: &str = "certificate-expiry";

pub const EXPIRY_DOC: &str = "## Description

A TLS certificate Canopy holds for this server is running out of life, and the renewal that should have replaced it has not happened. Canopy renews well before expiry and retries on its own, so this means renewal has been failing for a while — the name may no longer resolve to this server, or the DNS challenge may not be completing.

Both thresholds are fractions of the certificate's own lifetime rather than fixed durations, so a six-day certificate and a ninety-day one report at the same point in their lives.

A certificate for a name the server is no longer entitled to is not reported here at all: Canopy deliberately stopped renewing it, so its running out is the intended outcome.

## Results

- **warn** — past the point Canopy meant to renew, with room left to recover.
- **fail** — most of the renewal window is gone, or the certificate has expired outright.

## Solve

Check the server's certificates on its page in Canopy for the recorded error. Common causes: the group no longer controls the domain the name sits under, the server's TLS permission was withdrawn, the name's address records point elsewhere, or the certificate authority is refusing the order (which Canopy reports separately against itself).";

This server asked for a certificate and Canopy has never managed to obtain it. Told apart from a certificate about to expire on purpose: this is a deployment that never came up, not one about to go dark, and the two want different responses.

Canopy keeps retrying with a growing interval, so the order is not lost — but nothing will start serving TLS on that name until it succeeds.

## Results

- **fail** — an order has failed repeatedly without ever producing a certificate. Recovers when it succeeds, or when Canopy stops pursuing it.

## Solve

Read the recorded error on the server's page in Canopy. A first issuance usually fails because the name's DNS zone is not one Canopy manages, because the group's claim on the domain does not cover the name, or because the address records the challenge needs are not published yet.";

/// One check per server for address records Canopy could not publish.
pub const ADDRESS_REF: &str = "dns-records";

pub const ADDRESS_DOC: &str = "## Description

This server registered a public name with the addresses it is reachable at, and Canopy could not write those records into the DNS zone. The name will not resolve — or will keep resolving to wherever it pointed before — until the write succeeds.

Canopy retries every pass and keeps the server's stated intent, so nothing is lost; what is reported is that the zone has not caught up.

## Results

- **fail** — a registration's records have not been published and the last attempt failed. Recovers when the records are published.

## Solve

Read the recorded error on the server's page in Canopy. Usually either the zone the name sits under is not in Canopy's configuration, or Canopy's credentials for that zone have stopped working — the latter affects every name in the zone and is worth checking against the other servers in the group.";
