//! Operator-owned catalog of check policies: per (source, check), how an

//!
//! An entry carries a **ceiling** (the maximum effective result on the

//! as warnings, `passed` means recorded but never alerting, `skipped`
//! additionally tells the source not to bother running the check),

//! Ingestion (in the public-server status handler) calls
//! [`CheckPolicy::upsert_default`] for every check seen on a push, then
