//! Operator declarations that a machine, a group, or one of a group's
//! environments is being worked on.
//!
//! While a window suspends a target its checks are observed, graded, and
//! presented exactly as they would be without it. What the window holds back
//! is what those results feed: no issue on the target opens or joins an
//! incident, so nothing notifies, and an operator working through a window
//! watches the check they are fixing come good.
//!
//! A window is over the machine rather than over one workload on it. Taking a
//! box down to patch it stops everything running on it, so a window naming one
//! application would leave the others alerting through work that was always
//! going to stop them. One declaration, N consequences.
//!
//! Suspension outlasts the window itself by [`SETTLE`]. A machine is back
//! before the sources on it have reported again, and a machine whose every
//! source is stale is unreachable, so ending suspension the instant the work
//! finishes would page for a server that has just come back, for as long as
//! the work took.
