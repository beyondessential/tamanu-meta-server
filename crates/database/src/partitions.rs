//! Provisioning the weekly ranges the high-volume histories are written into.
//!
//! Spec: `.workhorse/specs/platform/history-storage.md` (id `HST`).
//!
//! `statuses` and `device_connections` are range-partitioned by week, and a
//! write only lands if a partition covering its timestamp exists — there is no
//! catch-all, so a week with no partition is a week the history cannot be
//! written at all. Canopy keeps the ranges provisioned ahead of itself from the
//! monitor loop rather than relying on an external schedule, and reports the
//! runway so the shortfall is alerted on long before it bites (see
//! [`crate::self_alerts::sweep_partition_runway`]).
//!
//! The DDL lives in SQL (`ensure_weekly_partitions`) because it has to: it
//! builds each partition detached and attaches it, which is what keeps it from
//! taking an exclusive lock on the history it is extending.
