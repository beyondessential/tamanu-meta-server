Status and connection history are stored in weekly ranges, and a write only lands if a range covering its timestamp exists. Canopy provisions ranges ahead of itself while it runs, so this alert means that provisioning has stopped happening — and there is a deadline attached, because a history with no range left cannot be written at all.

What breaks at the deadline is writing, not reading: status pushes and connection records start failing while queries over existing history keep working.

## Results

- **warn** — less than two weeks of range remain.
- **fail** — less than one week remains.

Both recover on the next successful provisioning pass, which needs nothing but a working monitor pod and a database that accepts DDL.

## Solve

The monitor pod provisions ranges every minute, so a runway that keeps shrinking means those passes are failing: check its logs for the week it could not provision and why. A permissions change on the database role, or a lock it cannot get, are the usual causes. Provisioning by hand is `SELECT ensure_weekly_partitions('statuses', 4)` (and the same for `device_connections`), which is idempotent and safe to run at any time.";

Canopy holds the DNS zones it may write records in as deployment configuration, and a group domain is only actionable while a configured zone covers it. This alert means at least one group is now depending on a domain Canopy cannot reach — usually a zone removed from the configuration while its claims stood, or a configuration that no longer parses.

Claims are never dropped for this: the group keeps the domain, and it keeps excluding other groups from overlapping it. What stops is Canopy acting on any name beneath it.

## Results

- **warn** — some claims fall outside the configured zones while others are covered, which is what removing one zone of several looks like. Either restore the zone to the configuration or release the claims that no longer belong.
- **fail** — the configuration is unreadable, or there are no zones at all while domains stand claimed. Canopy can serve no DNS or TLS for any group until it is fixed.

## Solve

Compare the zone list in Canopy's deployment configuration against the domains reported in the alert message. Restore the missing zone if its removal was accidental; if it was deliberate, release the claims on each group's page. A configuration that does not parse is reported with the parse error — fix the entry and restart.";

## Results

## Results

The certificate authority has told Canopy it is issuing too fast. Those limits are shared across every group whose domain sits in the same zone, so running them down is a fleet-wide fault rather than one group's — and retrying hard would spend what is left of the allowance on whichever name happened to fail last.

So Canopy stops working orders for a while rather than continuing to ask. Nothing is lost; issuance is slower until the allowance recovers.

## Results

- **fail** — the authority refused an order for rate limiting. Recovers once orders are going through again.

## Solve

Usually this resolves itself as the authority's window rolls forward. If it does not, look for a name being ordered repeatedly — a server asking for a certificate it cannot use, or a request loop — since one name failing over and over is the usual way an allowance is spent.

Pausing a server stops Canopy doing anything new on its behalf, including renewing its certificates. That is the point of a pause — but it also suppresses the per-server alerting that would otherwise chase a certificate running out, so a pause nobody remembers is exactly how certificates quietly expire.

This alert is that forgetting, reported against Canopy rather than against the deployment: only an operator can lift a pause, and Canopy never lifts one itself however much is expiring underneath it.

A certificate for a name the server is no longer entitled to is not counted: Canopy stopped renewing that on purpose, and the pause is not why it is running out.

## Results

- **warn** — a paused server holds a certificate past the point Canopy would have renewed it. There is still room to recover by lifting the pause.
- **fail** — a paused server holds a certificate that has expired. Whatever it serves on that name is now being rejected by clients.

## Solve

Look at each server named in the alert. Finish whatever the pause was for — the recorded reason is on the server's page — and unpause it; Canopy then works the renewals that fell due while it was paused. If the pause is no longer needed at all, lifting it is the whole fix. If the deployment is gone for good, archive the server or release the group's claim on the domain instead, which stops the certificates being Canopy's business.";
