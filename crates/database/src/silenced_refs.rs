//! Operator-managed silences, stored as scoped check policies.
//!
//! A silence is a scoped transform with a `skipped` ceiling (see
//! [`crate::check_policies::ScopedCheckPolicy`]): the matching check
//! keeps recording its observed results, but its effective result is
//! skipped, so it raises nothing and counts nowhere —
//! [`crate::issues::re_evaluate_incident_membership`] treats it as a
//! "should leave" reason, and the health rollups drop it.
//!
//! This module keeps the historical (source, ref) surface the private
//! API and UI speak: refs carry the `health/` namespace prefix for
//! source-reported checks, while the scoped-policy storage is keyed by
//! bare check name. The mapping is applied on the way in and out.
