//! Flat-variable payloads for Slack Workflow Builder webhook triggers.
//!
//! Workflow Builder webhooks don't accept Block Kit directly. Each workflow
//! declares a named set of text variables in its trigger; the actual message
//! is composed inside Slack's workflow editor using those variables. So we
//! POST a flat JSON object keyed by the declared variable names — no
//! `blocks`, no `text`.
//!
//! Two workflows:
//! - `incident_open`: variables `server`, `severity`, `source_ref`, `message`, `link`
//! - `incident_resolve`: variables `server`, `by`, `link`. `by` is either the
//!   resolving operator's login, or — when the incident retired on its own —
//!   "the healthcheck recovering" (it describes the event, not an actor: the
//!   check went healthy again, which does not imply nobody intervened).
//!
//! Note: `link` is **not** rendered here. It's pure config (incident_id is
//! already on the row, and `PRIVATE_URL` is operator-set), so the drainer
//! injects it at delivery time. That way only the drainer process needs to
//! see `PRIVATE_URL` — every other process that enqueues outbox rows
//! (public-server, private-server, reachability job) doesn't have to know
//! the operator-facing URL.

/// limit.", which the drainer then retries to exhaustion so the incident
/// never pages. Cap it well under Slack's message length limit, leaving the
