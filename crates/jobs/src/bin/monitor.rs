//! Canopy monitoring pod: the minute-cadence, DB-only sweeps that detect
//! problems and file/close incidents. One loop, one deployment — every sweep
//! here is a cheap read against the same DB, so there's no reason to stand up
//! a separate pod per check.
//!
//! Sweeps run each tick:
//! - **staleness** — look at every monitored server's report freshness against
//!   its down threshold and file (or close) the `(source=canopy,
//!   ref=reachability)` check when nothing at all is reporting, plus a
//!   `stale/<source>` check per reporting source that has gone quiet.
//! - **backup staleness + reconcile** — `database::backup::sweep`: stale
//!   reported runs / maintenance, and report-vs-inventory reconciliation.
//! - **tailnet key-expiry** — when the Tailscale directory is configured.
//!
//! Plus a startup **incident reconciliation** pass (see below).

///   window, opening 22 spurious incidents on unmonitored servers
///   that the NEW code's rules would never have opened, and which
///   nothing in the steady-state event flow would reconcile.
