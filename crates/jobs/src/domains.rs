//! Canopy domains pod: everything Canopy does inside the DNS zones it manages.
//!
//! Two jobs, one pod, because both need the same thing nothing else in Canopy
//! has — write access to the zones:
//!
//! - **addresses** — publish the A/AAAA records for the names applications have
//!   registered, and take them down when a name is withdrawn.
//! - **certificates** — drive orders at the certificate authority: publish the
//!   challenge record that proves control of a name, hand over the server's
//!   signing request, store the chain, and renew before it runs out.
//!
//! Neither is on a request path. A server asks for a certificate and collects it
//! later (see CRT), so the work here is allowed to take the minutes a DNS-01
//! challenge takes, and the pod being briefly down delays issuance rather than
//! failing it.
//!
//! Configuration decides how much of this runs. Without `CANOPY_DNS_ZONES` there
//! is nothing to write into and both sweeps idle; without
//! `CANOPY_ACME_ACCOUNT_KEY` there is no account to order with and the
//! certificate sweeps idle while addresses carry on. Either is a legitimate
//! deployment rather than an error, so each is reported once at startup and not
//! per tick.
