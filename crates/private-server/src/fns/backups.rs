//! Operator-facing backup-credentials endpoints (private-server, admin SPA).
//!
//! These are thin wrappers over the `database::backups` models. They drive the
//! group backup lifecycle (`provisioning → ready` — no escrow step; Canopy owns
//! and rotates the passphrase), per-`(group,type)` schedule/retention editing,
//! the one-off "backup now" request, and the read-only stats panel.
//!
//! At onboarding Canopy creates the repo-passphrase Secret via the kube client
//! on `AppState` (generated for from-birth, operator-supplied for passphrase
//! mode). The jobs-side init op then creates/connects the kopia repo and is the
//! writer of the observable `status`/`last_init_error` transitions.
