//! Enrolment: admitting a box to the fleet.
//!
//! An enrolment binds a machine to the identity that speaks for it. It concerns
//! no application, and cannot: an application comes into being from what a
//! reporting agent says about its box, and nothing can report until it has
//! enrolled. An enrolment that required an application would be waiting on the
//! one thing only it could bring about.
//!
//! So the operator creates the machine and mints it a ticket, the agent
//! presents that ticket and proves it holds the key, and the machine gains an
//! identity. What runs on the box follows from the first push.
//!
//! The routes stay mounted under `/servers` because that is where fielded
//! agents call them, and the id those agents send is the machine's.
// spec: FLT#identities
