/// Get the tags for the calling device's own server.
///
/// Returns the effective set of tags for the server the calling device is
/// registered as: any tags set on the server itself, overlaid onto any tags
/// inherited from its server group (a tag set on the server takes precedence
/// over a group tag with the same key). If the server isn't in a group,
/// this returns just its own tags.
///
/// The result also includes a few read-only, synthetic tags describing the
/// server, under the reserved `canopy:` key prefix: `canopy:kind`,
/// `canopy:rank` (if the server has one set), and `canopy:group-id` /
/// `canopy:group-name` (if the server belongs to a group). Operators cannot
/// set tags under that prefix, so these never collide with tags you set
/// yourself.
///
/// When the server belongs to a group, the effective `billing.*` labels are
/// also included, matching the labels canopy attributes to cloud resources:
/// `billing.product`, `billing.deployment`, and `billing.stage` (the last
/// derived from *this* server's own rank, and omitted when the server has no
/// rank). The stage is per-server, not the group's highest rank, so a `clone`
/// server reports `billing.stage=clone` rather than the group's `prod`.
///
/// These are only defaults: a stored `billing.*` tag is honoured over the
/// computed value — the server's own tag first, then the group's. So an
/// operator can pin any billing label on a specific server or the whole group.
///
/// - **401**: the request has no client certificate, or the certificate
///   doesn't match a known device.
/// - **409**: the calling device is attached to more than one server, which
///   should not normally happen; contact support if you see this.
/// - **412**: the device is registered but has not yet been attached to a
///   server.
