/** Headline health chip derived from the `HealthState` rollup (top-level
 * self-report AND per-check results), not the raw top-level `healthy`
 * bool — a server saying "healthy" while a check fails shows as Warning,
 * matching the status-dot border and `<HealthLegend>`.
 *
 * `stale` recolours to an outlined variant for servers that aren't
 * currently reporting, so an operator isn't misled into thinking a stale
 * "Healthy" still holds.
 *
 * `monitored={false}` fades the chip and sets a silence icon beside it:
 * canopy determines an unmonitored server's health the same way it does
 * everyone else's, so it can read Unhealthy while nobody is being paged.
 * The chip keeps its real colour and label underneath — the state is
 * true, it's the alerting that's off. */
