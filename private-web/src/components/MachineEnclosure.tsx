// The pill is the machine, so it carries the machine's state while the dots
// inside carry each application's. Every machine is enclosed, whether it runs
// one application or several: an enclosure never means anything on its own,
// only its contents do. A box hosting two workloads is one pill with two dots,
// which is the whole point of the grain.
//
// The pill is drawn as an outline with a wash rather than a solid fill, so the
// dots inside stay the loudest thing in it. A machine's state is context for
// its applications', not a competitor to it.
//
// Orange is the enclosure's alone, so each hue means one thing: light green a
// degraded application, orange a degraded machine, red down. A red pill is the
// box, and everything on it is unreachable with it.

// A window hatches the pill's wash rather than cutting through it the way a
// dot's does. A mask on the enclosure would clip the dots inside it as well,
// which would say something about the applications, and a window is the box's.
// The hatch runs the same way as the dot's maintenance cut, so the two read as
// one idea at either grain.
//
// A window washes the pill in the info hue, which is what marks maintenance
// everywhere else in the interface and is a colour no machine state uses: the
// ring's grey, orange and red are spoken for, so a blue wash cannot be read as
// a health verdict. The border still says how the box is, so a degraded box
// under a window shows both.
//
// A wash rather than a hatch because the ring is a few pixels wide: a pattern
// needs room to resolve into stripes, while a fill reads at any size. The
// settling state is the same hue washed back, and two strengths of a solid
// colour are separable where two strengths of a hatch are not.
