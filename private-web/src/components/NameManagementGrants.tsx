/// The two name-management grants, shown only when they could mean something.
///
/// A grant is exercised over names beneath a domain the server's *group*
/// controls, so it is worth nothing on its own. Where the deployment has no zones
/// and no group anywhere controls a domain, the feature is not in use at all and
/// these controls stay out of the way entirely — a checkbox that cannot affect
/// anything is worse than no checkbox. Where the feature is in use but this
/// group controls no domain, they show disabled with the reason, because that is
/// a gap an operator can close by claiming a domain.
///
/// Keyed on the *selected* group rather than the saved one, so moving the server
/// into a group that controls a domain makes the grants available before saving.
