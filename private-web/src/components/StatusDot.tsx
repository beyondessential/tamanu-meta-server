// One dot, one subject, one colourway.

// The dot used to say two things at once — a fill for reachability and a ring
// for health — because a server was a box and the software on it at once. The
// machine owns reachability now and carries it on the enclosure around the dot
// (see `MachineEnclosure`), so the dot spends its whole colourway on the one
// application, and an operator reads severity from the colour rather than
// decoding a ring.
//
// Red appears on both grains deliberately: red means down, and which element
// carries it says what went down. A red dot in a neutral pill is one
// application failing on a healthy box; a red pill is the box.
// spec: CHK#presentation

// better" rather than "degraded", so it reads as a shade of fine rather than a
// shade of trouble, and does not compete with a red for attention. Yellow stays
// out of the ramp entirely, being spoken for by the striped check-broken state.
